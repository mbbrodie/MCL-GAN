# Experimental Code

A sandbox area for backing up first draft code and accompanying tests. 

Once validated, we delete, forget, or move code/tests to their permanent destination. 

:warning: WARNING: Although gluten- and nut-free, these files contain unfinished, non-modular, and less-than-visually-appealing code. Use at your own risk.
