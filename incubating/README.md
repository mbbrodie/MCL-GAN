#Experimental Code

A sandbox area for backing up first draft code and accompanying tests. 

Once validated, we delete, forget, or move code/tests to their permanent destination. 

:warning: WARNING: These files may contain unfinished, non-modular, and less-than-visually-appealing code (and possibly nuts and gluten). Use at your risk.
