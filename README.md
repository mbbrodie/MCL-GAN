# MCL-GAN
TensorFlow ensembles for multiple-choice-learning. 

This research focuses on encouraging useful diversity for Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) problems (see [Stefan Lee's NIPS 2016 paper](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6270-stochastic-multiple-choice-learning-for-training-diverse-deep-ensembles.pdf)).  

We plan to introduce several new methods that represent a paradigm shift for handling MCL, or M-best, problems. Rather than training an ensemble of models using a diversity loss term, our approaches will focus model attention on different parts of the input space.
